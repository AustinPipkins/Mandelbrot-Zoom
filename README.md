# Mandelbrot-Zoom
This repo stores code I made for custom madelbrot zooms.

There are 2 versions of the script:
- Raw editor:
  - used for "long exposer", hyper detailed renders that take custom coordinates and presision parameters.
- Windowed View:
  - A small window for fast rendering and automated presision parameters
